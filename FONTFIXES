    https://github.com/powerline/fonts
    https://powerline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/linux.html#patched-font-installation
  Worked fine after that

  Install fonts using the powershell script in 2nd link above
  Add to vimrc:
    set endocing=utf-8

Work (redhat)
  install fonts as on home linux
  cp all from .local/share/fonts/ to ~/.fonts (fc-cache in redhad doesn't seem to read the first dir)
  run fc-cache -vf
  change terminal profile to use the one of the "... for Powerline" fonts (should show up after running prev. cmds)
